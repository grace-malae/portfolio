              I have experience in <b>agile methodology</b> and love to work in this kind of environment. I thrive as a <b>pair programmer</b>, but work great on my own.
              I know that <b>communication</b> is key in a team environment and know how important it is from experience.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-600 mb-8">
              I have also grown to like  <b>public speaking</b>! This is a skill I have built up over time, but now have no problem with speaking infront of a crowd, presenting, or talking to new people/employers/clients.
